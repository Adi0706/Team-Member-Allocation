# Team-Member-Allocation
This is a small project built using React Js. This project is a prototype of a team member allocation system which can be used by a company for their employee and projects.
I have learnt basic React Js through this project .

There are 2 teams A and B and there are total 6 employees working at the moment. There is a dropdown menu throught which we can select the team where we want to allocate the employee. 

Number of Allocated members is shown right below the header of the webpage .
